PONG SFML 64 bit

NOTES:
CURRENTLY WORKING ON PROJECT USING VISUAL STUDIO
----------------------
TODO
----------------------

Get event processing working
	-get simple pause button (space bar) working

Clean up code
	-currently a mess
	-maybe break stuff into functions

might need to rework physics updating in the future
		-ideally physics would be updated every clock tick
		-while graphics is limited to "x times per second"

Add a paddle for the ball to bounce off of
	-add controls for player to move paddle back and forth
		-most likely a key press would increase the paddle's acceleration along an axis by a set amout per press
			-left / right - X axis
			-up / down - Y axis

Physics currently lacks any acceleration decay over time (air resistance), moving objects keep moving without slowing down
unless code is put in  with collisionDetection to stop it

Add collision detection between physobj
	-made a Mesh class for calculating / tracking points of a shape
	-currently only a square / rectangle shape
	-collision detection between ball and paddle works
		-there's a little gap between the ball and paddle, could try to remove that
		-make a bounce() function that when called will take the ball instance and reverse the acc and vel
			-could eventually do research to see how to do more realistic physical simulation of a bouncing ball

Add a wall to bounce the ball off of (1 player game)

Could have a two player game with two paddles on opposite sides of the screen

Add a menu screen for user to select between 1 or 2 player mode

Add game data such as tracking scores

Create a basic AI to play with in 2 player that controls teh other paddle

rework project structure to be self contained (currently have SFML include files pathing to Libraries in VS files)
-removed various files produced by vs from github repo directories
-added a .gitignore file
