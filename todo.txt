PONG SFML 64 bit

NOTES:
CURRENTLY WORKING ON PROJECT USING VISUAL STUDIO
----------------------
TODO
----------------------

might need to rework physics updating in the future
		-ideally physics would be updated every clock tick
		-while graphics is limited to "x times per second"

Add a paddle for the ball to bounce off of
	-requires drawing a rectangle - done
	-create a Paddle class which contains a sf::Rectangle sprite and derived data from PhysObj

Add collision detection between physobj (requires calculating a shape for bounds, like a circle or rectangle)

Add a wall to bounce the ball off of (1 player game)

Could have a two player game with two paddles on opposite sides of the screen

Add a menu screen for user to select between 1 or 2 player mode

Add game data such as tracking scores

Create a basic AI to play with in 2 player that controls teh other paddle

rework project structure to be self contained (currently have SFML include files pathing to Libraries in VS files)
-removed various files produced by vs from github repo directories
-add a .gitignore file
