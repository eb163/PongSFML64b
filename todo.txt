PONG SFML 64 bit

NOTES:
CURRENTLY WORKING ON PROJECT USING VISUAL STUDIO
----------------------
TODO
----------------------
put files up on github for easy access / updating / version control

rework time system using SFML time

might need to rework physics updating in the future
		-ideally physics would be updated every clock tick
		-while graphics is limited to "x times per second"

Merge Ball physics object and CircleShape in one class
	-use inheritance?

Add a paddle for the ball to bounce off of
	-requires drawing a rectangle
	-do you want the paddle to be a physics based obj with acceleration, velocity, etc
	 or just have the controls move the position of the paddle?
	-requires collision detection
		-might be able to use sf::Rectangle class
		-see if sf::CircleShape class tracks edges of circle

Add a wall to bounce the ball off of (1 player game)

Could have a two player game with two paddles on opposite sides of the screen

Add a menu screen for user to select between 1 or 2 player mode

Add game data such as tracking scores

rework project structure to be self contained (currently have SFML include files pathing to Libraries in VS files)
